# codechef-notifier
Tired of waiting on codechef to see whether your submission is correct then this is the solution for you.<br><br>
This extension observes your activity and automatically follows your submission when you do it. It then notifies you when the
result has arrived.<br><br>
So all you have to do is make the submission and proceed with your other activities. When the result comes it will notify you.<br><br>
Also you can click on the extension icon to see how you performed on various subtasks of you submission. It reports you every 
detail that you will find on the codechef's result page.<br><br>
Use <b>alt+shift+delete</b> key to instantly remove all the cached result or you could click on the <b>"DONE"</b> button of the popup to 
delete a particular cached result. <br><br>
The results are stored only for the same browser session in which  the subission result is obtained.<br><br>
The extension will also check the results of your submission even if the browser was closed before the results could arrive. 
So that way when the next time you open up your browser it will automatically check for all your pending submissions.
